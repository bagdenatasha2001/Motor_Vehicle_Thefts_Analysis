# Motor_Vehicle_Thefts_Analysis

## Project Overview:

This repository contains a Power BI project analyzing motor vehicle theft data sourced from the New Zealand Police Department. It aims to visualize trends, identify hotspots, and provide insights into stolen vehicle statistics. The project leverages real-time data to enhance community awareness and support crime prevention efforts. 

Stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand police department's vehicle of interest database containing 6 months of data. Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, with data on vehicle type, make, year, color, date stolen and region stolen.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI: Used for creating visualizations and building an interactive dashboard.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create measures and calculated columns for advanced data analysis.

## Project Objectives:

 The primary objective of the Motor Vehicle Theft Analysis Dashboard is to provide comprehensive insights into the patterns and trends of motor vehicle thefts in New Zealand. 

* Analyze Theft Data: Utilize six months of stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand Police Department to identify key trends, including peak theft periods and commonly 
                     stolen vehicle models.

*  Visualize Insights: Create interactive visualizations using Power BI that allow users to explore theft data through dynamic dashboards, facilitating a better 
              understanding of theft patterns.
*  dentify Hotspots: Map theft incidents geographically to pinpoint hotspots, aiding law enforcement and community efforts in targeted prevention strategies.

* Enhance Community Awareness: Provide valuable insights that can be shared with the community to raise awareness about vehicle theft prevention and encourage proactive 
   measures.

*  Support Decision-Making: Equip stakeholders, including policymakers and law enforcement agencies, with data-driven insights to inform strategies for reducing vehicle 
   theft rates.

## Key Insights:
- The dataset indicates that a total of 4,553 vehicles were reported stolen.
- The average age of the vehicles stolen is 23 years.
- The dataset reveals a sharp increase in vehicle thefts after March 2022.
- The data indicates that over 95% of stolen vehicles are classified as standard vehicles.
- The Oakland region has the highest number of vehicle theft incidents compared to other regions.
- The Oakland region also has a large population, and the data shows that theft incidences are higher in more densely populated regions.
- The station wagon vehicle type is the most frequently targeted for theft.
- Monday experiences the highest number of vehicle theft incidents compared to other days of the week.


 ## Conclusion :
The dashboard provides a detailed understanding of stolen vehicle patterns, highlighting critical factors such as vehicle make, type, day, and region. Key findings include:

* Toyota, Trailers, and Station Wagons are primary targets due to their popularity, availability, and demand in the resale market.

* Theft activity is concentrated on weekends (especially Saturdays), indicating a need for heightened surveillance during these times.

* Urban regions experience more thefts due to higher vehicle density, while rural areas are less affected.

* Standard vehicles are overwhelmingly targeted compared to luxury ones, emphasizing the need for better security measures for common vehicles.

* Specific vehicle types like heavy trailers and boat trailers are less stolen, likely due to logistical or resale challenges.


## Recommendations for Future Action :


 * Strengthen Security for Popular Makes:
          Focus on brands like Toyota and vehicle types like Station Wagons. Anti-theft measures (tracking systems, alarms, etc.) should be prioritized.

* Enhance Weekend Surveillance:
          Allocate more law enforcement resources during weekends in high-theft regions.

* Public Awareness Campaigns:
         Educate vehicle owners about theft patterns and encourage the use of steering locks, GPS tracking, and other theft deterrents.

* Regional Focus:
         Identify high-theft regions from the data and implement targeted crime prevention strategies.
